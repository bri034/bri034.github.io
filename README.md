We Bare Bears is an animated show centers around three bears—Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear—and their eager and often comic attempts to fit into a human society. Set in San Francisco, the three bears live in a cave on the outskirts of town and work together to make human friends and have adventures.

-Ice Bear is almost always stoic and quiet, though not inherently unfriendly. He's rarely seen smiling, but he is the most polite and mature of the brothers. In fact, Ice Bear is notably more observant and has a better keen sense of danger than his brothers!
